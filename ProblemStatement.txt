The exercise revolves around predicting the performance of a robot under varied conditions. 
The data includes details of some of the equipment used to build the robot. 
The robot can have different kinds of motors, screws etc. The "class" variable depicts the time required for the system to respond. 
Objective is to create a linear regression model with high accuracy in predicting the variable “class” given the observations.
The variables that describe the data set and their values are the following:

[,1]	 Motor	 A,B,C,D,E
[,2]	 Screw	 A,B,C,D,E
[,3]	 Pgain	 3,4,5,6
[,4]	 Vgain	 1,2,3,4,5
[,5]	 Class
